    "correct_explanation": "Even with an intervention that effectively reduces lung cancer rates, it wouldn’t necessarily suggest a greater prevalence of smoking genes. This is because the presence of smoking genes coupled with smoking behavior increases lung cancer risk, and without considering changes in smoking behavior, the genetic aspect alone does not conclusively determine lower lung cancer rates.",
