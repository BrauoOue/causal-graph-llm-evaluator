If an intervention ensures that managers always sign the termination letters, will this increase the chance of the employee being fired?\", 'Ground Truth': 'No', 'Explanation': \"Given that the existing data shows lower probabilities of firing with the manager's signature, an intervention ensuring that managers always sign the termination letters would keep the probability of the employee being fired at the lower rates (10% and 33%), thereby not increasing the chance.\"}, {'Scenario ID': 250, 'Question Type': 'Inference from Effect to Cause without Intervention', 'Scenario and Question': \"Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of CEO's decision to fire the employee is 89%. If an employee is fired, is it more likely that the manager signed the termination letter?\", 'Ground Truth': 'No', 'Explanation': \"The probabilities of employee termination being higher when managers do not sign (60% and 80%) as compared to when they do sign (10% and 33%) indicate that it is more likely that the termination happened without the manager's signature when an employee is fired.\"}, {'Scenario ID': 250, 'Question Type': 'Inference from Effect to Cause with Intervention', 'Scenario and Question': 'Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. Assuming an intervention that guarantees an employee gets fired, is it likely that the manager signed the termination letter?', 'Ground Truth': 'No', 'Explanation': \"Given that the chance of firing is much higher without the manager's signature on the termination letter (with rates of 60% and 80%), an intervention that guarantees an employee gets fired would align with the conditions where manager's signing is less likely, therefore it is not likely that the manager signed under these guaranteed conditions.\"}, {'Scenario ID': 250, 'Question Type': 'Inference from Cause to Effect without Intervention', 'Scenario and Question': 'Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: CEO has a direct effect on director and manager. Manager has a direct effect on employee. Director has a direct effect on employee. The overall probability of manager signing the termination letter is 25%. The probability of manager not signing the termination letter and employee being fired is 59%. The probability of manager signing the termination letter and employee being fired is 6%. Is the chance of employee being fired larger when observing manager signing the termination letter?', 'Ground Truth': 'No', 'Explanation': 'The probability of an employee being fired decreases significantly (from 59% to 6%) when the manager signs the termination letter, which indicates that signing actually reduces the likelihood of firing.'}]\n"
